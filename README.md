# RT-HippoNeuroStim: Real-time simulations of hippocampal neurostimulation

## Overview

Real-time FPGA implementation of a conductance-based hippocampal model to study neurostimulation.
The RT-HippoNeuroStim project aims at translating the hippocampal model previously developed by A. Aussel (https://elifesciences.org/articles/87356), together with Fabien Wagner (IMN), onto the new neuromorphic computing architecture Bioemus developed by the team of Timoth√©e Levi at the IMS (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48905-x). Bioemus is based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and is much more efficient than current simulation software. We will leverage this platform to simulate the activity of the hippocampus in real time, which will greatly accelerate research on hippocampal neurostimulation.
